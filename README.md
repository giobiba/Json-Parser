# Parser

## Writing a json parser in haskell 
* this little program I wrote with the help of the site linked below can parse through the JSON format, can detect and transform into haskell strings surrogate characters from unicode. In addition it ignores whitespace characters
* It does not have any explicit error messages, but I plan on adding it in the future 


**Many thanks to this very detailed and well explained tutorial that I followed for this parser. You can find it at this [link](https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/json-parsing-from-scratch-in-haskell/),**
